## âœ… Program 831
**File:** `practice/program831.java`  
**Date:** [Add the date you created it]

### ðŸ”¹ Description
This was the **first practice program** written during the journey of building the customized DBMS.  
It demonstrates:
- Declaring a **LinkedList** in Java
- Adding elements (`10, 20, 30, 40`) into it
- Printing the list contents directly

### ðŸ”¹ Key Learning
- How to use **Java Collections Framework** (`LinkedList` class).
- `LinkedList` automatically prints all elements inside square brackets when passed to `System.out.println`.
- Difference between **primitive arrays** and **collections** like `LinkedList`.

### ðŸ”¹ Output
Data from LL is : [10, 20, 30, 40]

### ðŸ”¹ Outcome
- Learned the basics of working with **LinkedList**.  
- This foundation will later be useful when storing employee records in the DBMS implementation.
