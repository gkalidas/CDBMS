# CDBMS
A custom-built database management system (CDBMS) in Java for managing employee records using file-based serialization. Supports CRUD operations with a console interface.

# CDBMS – Customized DBMS

This repository contains simple programs and experiments related to building a **customized database management system**.
It is written in **Java (for now)**, with plans to convert later into **Python** as well.

```

* `src/cdbms/` → All Java source files.
* `HISTORY.md` → Keeps track of incremental changes made to each program.

## ▶️ Running the Program

1. Navigate to the `src` directory:

   ```bash
   cd src
   ```

2. Compile all Java files:

   ```bash
   javac cdbms/*.java
   ```

3. Run the main class (example: `CDBMSApplication`):

   ```bash
   java cdbms.CDBMSApplication
   ```

## 🔄 Next Steps

* Add more database-related logic incrementally.
* Convert Java programs to **Python equivalents** in later commits.
* Improve modularity and structure for easier experimentation.

## 📜 History

Check [HISTORY.md](./HISTORY.md) for incremental updates on what changed in each program.
